# Assignment 2

This folder contains codes and supplemental material for the assignment 2.


## Files
- run.py
  - This python script was used to predict freezing of gate using text-based fall description.
  - NLP architecture was constructed using multiple machine learning algorithms including decision tree, XGBoost, k-nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machine, logistic regression, and naive bayes.
  - Different features sets were constructed, including n-gram vector, dense vector embedding using word2vec, word clusters, demographics, and location of previous fall incidence.
- run.R
  - This R script was used for descriptive analysis and figure generation.
- Supplemental document
  - This is a supplemental document containing the model performance results comparing different combination of machine learning algorithms and feature sets.
